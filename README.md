# Draft Concluder

Based on [an idea by John Blackbourn](https://twitter.com/johnbillion/status/1314494422529331203), this plugin is designed to punish those who leave draft posts unloved. Although I've not implemented the suggestion of making the plugin un-uninstallable, the rest of John's ideas are here, with more to boot.

* Send emails out on a daily or weekly schedule
* Look for draft posts and/or pages
* Target those drafts that were created more than a specific time period ago, or have not been updated for a while
* Each user, who has drafts that then reminding about, will receive an email. No, they can't unsubscribe from them
* Each email will show the number of drafts, along with a reminder of each of them

Oh, and, naturally, the code passes WordPress and WordPress VIP coding standards.

Always forgetting to complete posts or you have other people on your site who do? This is the draft botherer that you need!
