# Draft Concluder

Based on [an idea by John Blackbourn](https://twitter.com/johnbillion/status/1314494422529331203), this plugin is designed to be a reminder to those who leave draft posts unloved. And, yes, all of John's ideas are here, with more to boot.

* Send emails out on a daily or weekly schedule and at a time that you'd prefer
* Look for draft pages as well as posts, if you like. Or just pages, if that's what you want. We won't judge
* Target those drafts that were created more than a specific time period ago, or have not been updated for a while
* Each user, who has drafts that then reminding about, will receive an email. No, they can't unsubscribe from them
* Each email will show the number of drafts, along with a reminder of each of them
* Optional ability to prevent the plugin from being deactivated (allow you to avoid the temptation to do so rather than, you know, deal with the drafts)

Oh, and, naturally, the code passes [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) and [WordPress VIP](https://github.com/Automattic/VIP-Coding-Standards) coding standards üéâ

Always forgetting to complete posts or you have other people on your site who do? This is the draft botherer that you need!
